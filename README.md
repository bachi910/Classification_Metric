## Classification_Metric

This repo briefly describes about the different classification metrics used in the industry to evaluate the model.
The most important task in building any machine learning model is to evaluate its performance. So, the question arises how would one measure the success of a machine learning model? How would we know when to stop the training and evaluation and when to call it good?

Evaluation metrics are tied to machine learning tasks. There are different metrics for the tasks of classification and regression. Some metrics, like precision recall, are useful for multiple tasks. Classification and regression are examples of supervised learning, which constitutes a majority of machine learning applications. Using different metrics for performance evaluation, we should be able to improve our modelâ€™s overall predictive power before we roll it out for production on unseen data. Without doing a proper evaluation of the Machine Learning model by using different evaluation metrics, and only depending on accuracy, it can lead to a problem when the respective model is deployed on unseen data and may end in poor predictions.
